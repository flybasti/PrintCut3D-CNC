Welcome to the Open Source Project PrintCut3D CNC Maschine

The hole project is for free, but some guys ask me how they can give me a donation. It`s possible via Paypal

Shortly here will be the hole Step Files for the Maschine a Bom List and a building guide. I have the Maschine in operation for almost a year and I am very satisfied with it. 

The workspace is 170mm x 640mm x 800mm.The y axis can be extended very easily.  Up to 1000mm only one ball screw is required. Larger dimensions should use two.
 
It is also possible to extend the x axis, but this requires enlarging the front sides and the bottom plate.  The bottom plate should then be better chosen in 12mm.  You should also use two ball screws.
